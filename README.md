Backs up vaultwarden files and directories to `tar.xz` archives automatically. `tar.xz` archives can be opened using data compression programs like [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) and [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/).

Files and directories that are backed up:
- db.sqlite3
- config.json
- rsa_key.der
- rsa_key.pem
- rsa_key.pub.der
- /attachments
- /sends

## Usage

#### Automatic Backups
Refer to the `docker-compose` section below. By default, backing up is automatic.

#### Manual Backups
Pass `manual` to `docker run` or `docker-compose` as a `command`.

## docker-compose
```
services:
  vaultwarden:
    # Vaultwarden configuration here.
  backup:
    image: jmqm/vaultwarden_backup:latest
    container_name: vaultwarden_backup
    network_mode: none
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - /vaultwarden_data_directory:/data:ro # Read-only
      - /backup_directory:/backups

      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro # Container uses date from host.
    environment:
      - DELETE_AFTER=30
      - CRON_TIME=0 0 * * * # Runs at 12:00 AM.
      - UID=1024
      - GID=100
```

## Volumes _(permissions required)_
`/data` _(read)_- Vaultwarden's `/data` directory. Recommend setting mount as read-only.

`/backups` _(write)_ - Where to store backups to.

User specified in compose environment (`UID`/`GID`) vars must have write access to `/backups`
If you want to make them the owner of the backups directory do: 
```
chown ${UID}:${GID} /path/to/backups
```
