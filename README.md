Backs up vaultwarden files and folders to `tar.xz` archives.
Can be set to run automatically.

## Usage

#### Automatic Backups
Refer to the `docker-compose` section below. By default, backing up is automatic.

#### Manual Backups
Pass `manual` to `docker run` or `docker-compose` as a `command`.

## docker-compose
```
services:
  vaultwarden:
	# Vaultwarden configuration here.
  backup:
    image: jmqm/vaultwarden_backup
    container_name: vaultwarden_backup
    volumes:
      - "/vaultwarden_data_directory:/data:ro" # Read-only
      - "/backup_directory:/backups"

      - "/etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro" # Container uses date from host.
    environment:
      - DELETE_AFTER=30 #optional
      - CRON_TIME=* */24 * * * # Runs every 24 hours.
      - UID=1024
      - GID=100
```
